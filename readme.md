<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project started as a quick and dirty way to develop ideas for the many MVP ideas that I wanted to make and test to see if they where actually good ideas. **Bijou** *only* includes what is necessary (that may change over time) to flesh out an idea. Classes currently included: Router, Session, View, Request, Str, Database, App.

Simple security and authentication will be added in the future.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Routing:
```php
<?php
require "../vendor/autoload.php";

use MVP\App;
use MVP\View;

$app = new App;

// The most basic example of routing:
$app->getRouter()->get("/", function($request)
{
    echo "Page Loaded!";
});

// Same example as above but this one loads a view template:
$app->getRouter()->get("/", function($request)
{
    $view = new View();
    $view->render('home');
});

```
